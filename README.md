This simple portfolio page with kinda weird name was created summer 2012 for my friend, which really like to be photographed. 
It loades images from the /assets/images directory. The plan was to connect it with S3, made dynamic model etc. but client changed his mind and decided to discontinue this project.

Uses a bit of JS, built in Ruby On Rails, works on the most desktop browsers.
